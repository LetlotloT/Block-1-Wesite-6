         <h1>My First Block Coding</h1>
         <p>
            <p>As a music student, taking a course that does not correspond with any of my other courses was a risk. Taking a course that I had no background knowledge on was an attempt to fail. It was my interest in understand the power of the internet in our everyday lives and in how it affects our musicking that keeps me interested. I must say that I am enjoying the theory content more than the coding itself. However, I now understand that it all starts with the code. Most of my interaction with music start with a code, whether it is streaming or composing on a software, there is code. I am beginning to understand the power of this craft. 
            </p>
            <p>Building my first website has been a rollercoaster journey. On some days the journey is simple and I understand the code. On other days I am frustrated because my code has errors, only to find that I used the wrong bracket. However, I had decided from the moment I registered for this course that I will take it one day at a time and always remind myself not to compare myself people who have been coding for years. Therefore, for my first website, I have decided keep it simple, use code that I have learned during lectures and try not to do anything I have not yet learned in class. Also, feedback on this website will also help me understand the kind of work and level of work that is expected of me for the remainder of this year.
